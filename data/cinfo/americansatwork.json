   "additional-note": "Americans at Work was a radio program broadcast by the Columbia Broadcasting System.   It appears to have begun in 1939. We do not know when it ended. It is possible that some episodes might have been renewed under Dramas. We have not found any such renewals filed there for 1939 episodes in 1966 or 1967.  (The first renewal we have found, for number 21, was filed under Periodicals.)  We have not systematically searched Drama volumes for episodes from other years, however.",
