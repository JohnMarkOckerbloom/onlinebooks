Fox mentions that it had been previously published serially in the Long Island Sunday Press, among other newspapers, under the title 'Winter Kill'.  The record does not give dates, but it is possible that this renewal may cover installments published in this newspaper in 1950 (possibly including some prior to January 29).",
