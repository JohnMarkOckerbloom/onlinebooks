     "This is a British publication.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US.",
     "This magazine sometimes reprinted stories that originally appeared in other publications, and that might have active copyrights from those publications. The FictionMags index notes many of these reprints. We have not systematically checked whether any of the reprints from the 1930s still have active copyrights based on their original publication."
