    "Renewals for this annual were initially filed under Books, not Periodicals.  We are not sure if there were any more published after 1947.",
    "This serial includes reprints of stories originally published in other venues. While we know of no contribution renewals prior to 1964 that specifically mention this collection, we have not checked for renewals that cover the stories as originally published, or for whether their original publications are subject to GATT copyright restoration."
