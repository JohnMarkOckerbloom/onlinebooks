     "Contribution renewals are recorded beginning in the 1977 July-December CCE volume, but the earliest contribution renewal that specifically mentions this magazine is in the registered works database.",
     "Some of the stories in this magazine are reprints or condensations of previously published stories (including various Zane Grey novels).  We have not systematically checked the copyright status of those reprints.  However, the Zane Grey story in the very first issue is an abridgement of 'Sunset Pass', originally serialized in 1928, which has a copyright renewal that is still active as of this writing."
