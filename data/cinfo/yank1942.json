   "The only active contribution renewals for this periodical are listed in the Artwork section of the Catalog of Copyright Entries, and not in the Contributions to Periodicals section. The renewals are for certain 1944 'Sad Sack' comic strips. The two renewed strips we have been able to examine, from the March 24 and 31 issues, did have copyright notices lettered in them. Sad Sack comics appeared in 'Yank' since its first issue in 1942. Baker in 1971 also renewed a book titled 'The Sad Sack' that had been published in 1944.",
