   "The British periodical 'Answers' (1888-1956) used the title 'Answers to Correspondents' in its early years, but appears to have been known simply as 'Answers' since 1890.  (The 'see also' link above has more details.)  At this time, we cannot be sure that the 1930s issues cited here are from that periodical.",
   "The first and only book or contribution renewal mentioning this periodical title is a 1967 renewal for Laura E. Richards' 'What shall the children read?', mentioned as being serially published in 'Answers to Correspondents' from June 1938 to March 1939.  A 1967 renewal is probably too late for installments published in 1938, but might cover installments published in 1939.  We do not know enough about this periodical to know the issue date of the first 1939 installment."],
