      "This is a French publication. Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US.",
      "This record is for special issues of Le Particulier, a magazine that began in 1949, and for which special issues have their own ISSN.  We are not sure when special issues of Le Particulier started to be published, but we have found no renewals specicaly mentioning this title. If the issue has a distinctive title, though, search also for renewals under that title."
