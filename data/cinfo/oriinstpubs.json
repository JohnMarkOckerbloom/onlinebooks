     "The earliest issue renewal noted here is for the earliest active renewal record to specifically mention Oriental Institute Publications.  It was filed under Books, not Periodicals.  Before concluding a volume before or after this one is in the public domain, search for renewals for the volume under its distinctive title. We have not systematically checked volume titles for this serial.",
