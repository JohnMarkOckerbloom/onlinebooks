      "This is a British publication. Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. Penn's catalog record indicates that some issues were published in Washington, DC for the IISS; we are not sure if those were first publications, simultaneous publications, or publications at a different time than publication abroad.",
      "Issues prior to 1963 may have slightly different titles, though it appears that 'Military Balance' appears in them at least as a subtitle.  We have not found any copyright renewals for serials with 'Military' and 'Balance' anywhere in the title."
