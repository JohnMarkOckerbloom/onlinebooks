      "A 1969 renewal for Curtis Bok's book 'Backbone of the Herring' mentions that parts of it were published in The Shingle between 1939 and 1941.  The 1941 stories that this renewal might cover are listed here. Ulen stories continued until December 1941, but the stories after June 1941 do not appear to be represented in the book."
