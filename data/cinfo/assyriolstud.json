      "The first renewal shown here refers to the lowest-numbered volume with a CCE renewal record specifically mentioning this serial. The renewal was filed under Books, as were renewals for some later volumes in this series, rather than under Periodicals. This is a monographic series, so before concluding other volumes are in the public domain, search for renewals for a volume under its distinctive title. We have not systematically checked volume titles for this serial.",
