   "additional-note": "A 1977 renewal for the Transactions of the Southern Surgical Association 60th annual meeting notes that portions were published in the May and June [1949] issues of Annals of Surgery.  The renewal record specifically mentions new material, but we note it here in case the renewal covers any of the 1949 articles. (The Annals of Surgery are also mentioned in a couple of other 1977 renewals, but May and June appear to be the earliest 1949 issues referred to.)",
