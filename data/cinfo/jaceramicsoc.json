The original registration referenced in the CCE notice was for the entire issue.   We are not sure whether the renewal covers the entire issue, or just the Ceramic Abstracts section, so we have specified that issue for both the first renewed issue and the first renewed contribution. There are similar renewals associated with later issues.  Ceramic Abstracts has also sometimes been issued as its own periodical.",
