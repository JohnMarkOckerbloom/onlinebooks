      "This is a Canadian publication. Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. American agents are mentioned on the masthead of the December 1925 issue.",
      "A 1983 renewal record for the 1955 book 'Hello to Springtime' by Robert Louis Fontaine mentions that one chapter had been previously published in the Canadian Forum in 1954.  That renewal is likely to be too late to cover the Canadian Forum publication."
