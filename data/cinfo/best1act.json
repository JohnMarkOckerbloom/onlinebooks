      "Renewals for volumes of this annual typically appear in the Books section of the CCE rather than Periodicals.",
      "The earliest renewed contribution recorded here is the first one we found in the Books section of the CCE specifically mentioning this annual.  Renewals for plays published in the annual may have also been noted in the Drama section of the CCE, and might or might not mention inclusion in this collection.  We have not systematically surveyed Drama renewals."
