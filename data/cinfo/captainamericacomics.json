The first cataloged renewal, mentioned in the January-Jun 1968 CCE Books volume, is for the March 1941 issue.  Renewals for this issue and later issues also appear in the 1977 July-December CCE Periodicals volume.  For some reason, the issues are specified there as in 'volume 2', but as far as I know the March 1941 issue is the first appearance of Captain America.",
   "The series was retitled Captain America's Weird Tales for the October 1949 and February 1950 issues.  Publication was then suspended, briefly revived in 1954, and then, like the title character, put in suspended animation until the 1960s."],
