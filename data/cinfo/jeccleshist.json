      "This is a British publication. Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. However, the 1967-1968 volumes list a US subscription agent and US subscription price.  We did not find copyright notices in them. Other volumes around the same time may be similar, but we have not examined them.",
