      "Volume 1, number 1 of Parade (Spring 1936) was registered for copyright by William J. McElwee in 1936.  There is also a Volume 2, number 1 issue of Parade dated February 1937 and copyrighted in 1937 by Time, Inc, and another Volume 1, number 1 of Parade dated December 1938 and copyrighted in 1938 by Parade Pub. Co. We are not sure if these are all the same serial, but these are the only periodical registrations we have found for a periodical called Parade between 1936 and the 1941 beginning of the Parade Magazine that has run for decades since then as a Sunday newspaper supplement insert.",
   "The only active renewal we have found for pre-1941 Parades is for a contribution to the Spring 1936 issue, listed in this record."
