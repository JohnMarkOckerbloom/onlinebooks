      "This is a British publication. Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. Volume title pages as far back as the early 20th century mention both British and American publisher locations.",
      "This periodical includes songs and music, which might have renewals under Music, rather than under Contributions to Periodicals. We have not systematically checked Music renewals."
