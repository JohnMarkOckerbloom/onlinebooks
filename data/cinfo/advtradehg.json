      "The October 1932 issue is the first active renewal that specifically mentions the advance trade edition. Some issues prior to 1929 had separate renewals for regular issues and advance trade bulletins, but those copyrights have expired by 2024.  We assume that renewals for advance trade editions also cover the regular edition of the magzine, so we note them there as well.",
