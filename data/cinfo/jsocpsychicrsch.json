Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. However, as far back as the 1910s the Society has actively sold subscriptions in the US through an American agent, which encouraged American libraries serving the public to become members.",
