      "The Magazine was included in Sunday issues of The New York Times. The Times began filing general renewals for issues from April 1, 1928 onward.  Prior to that time, there were issue renewals specifically for the Magazine.  The first issue renewal shown here is the first active renewal we have found for a Sunday issue of The New York Times, which we assume includes the Magazine.",
