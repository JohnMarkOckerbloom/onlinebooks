   "additional-note": "Renewed contributions for Playbill appear beginning in the January-June 1967 CCE volume, but the earliest renewed contribution is mentioned in the July-December 1967 volume.  Issues of Playbill typically consist of a common 'wrapper' accompanying material specific to a particular show where the issues are distributed. I expect that the renewals associated with Playbill in CCE might only be for the common wrapper material.",
