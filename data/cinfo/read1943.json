     "A note in the 1970 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The first issue renewal was recorded in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, and was filed in 1970. We have not found evidence that this particular magazine (whose cover called it 'The NEW Magazine for EVERYBODY') was published after 1943, though other magazines also named 'Read' were.",
     "This appears to be distinct from a different magazine called 'Read' that in 1943 was published by Rodale Press and was in its 15th volume.  It also is likely to be distinct from the school magazine published in the later 20th century that might be included in the FictionMags listings."
