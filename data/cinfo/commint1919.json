      "This periodical, originating in Russia, was published in multiple editions in different languages and countries in the early 20th century.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. There was at least one edition published in the United States; we do not know if its contents were generally first published in their original language within 30 days of their first publication in the US.",
