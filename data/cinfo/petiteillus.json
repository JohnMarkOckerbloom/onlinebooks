     "This supplement to L'Illustration ran multiple series.  Some included plays that were renewed under Drama instead of under Contributions to Periodicals.  We have not systematically surveyed Drama renewals, and there may be renewed plays published in this periodical before the first renewal shown here.",
     "This is a French publication.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US."
