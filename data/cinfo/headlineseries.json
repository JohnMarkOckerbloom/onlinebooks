   "additional-note": "The renewal record for #60 in CCE is the first one to specifically mention Headline Series.  However, since many of the issues in this series were monographs, the monograph title for an issue should also be checked (as a book) to see if it was renewed.  The CCE renewal record for the first issue to be renewed, number 13, was filed in Books under its title 'War in China', rather than in Periodicals, and did not mention Headline Series or Headline Books. There are other similarly renewed titles between numbers 13 and 60, but we have not systematically checked renewals for issue titles past number 44. Some issues mention reprinting of material that was originally published elsewhere.",
