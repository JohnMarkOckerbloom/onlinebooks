    "The first renewal documented here is filed under Books, not under Periodicals. As this is a monographic series, there may be renewals for other volumes similarly filed.  Before concluding a volume is in the public domain, search for renewals for a book under its distinctive title.  We have not systematically done such searches for this serial after volume 9.",
