   "Some images from the New York American Journal were renewed separately in the Artwork section, rather than in the Contributions to Periodicals section.  The first such image with an active copyright is by Jimmy Murphy, and is titled 'Toots & Casper. Isn't it odd.'.  It ran in the April 25, 1926 issue, and was renewed in 1953.",
