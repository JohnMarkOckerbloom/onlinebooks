   "additional-note": "The Eternal Light was an American religious program broadcast on NBC radio and TV from 1944 to 1989. This record is for the associated periodical (ISSN 0423-5207), which appears to have included scripts from the program. While we found no renewals specifically for the periodical, we did find renewals for some of the program episodes in the registered works database.  There may also be additional copyrights covering material in this periodical under Drama, Motion Pictures, or Sound Recordings, sections of the CCE that we have not systematically surveyed.",
