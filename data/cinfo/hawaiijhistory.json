      "Rights statement assumes that pre-1989 issues have copyright notices.   We have not found them on early issues, but we are not sure whether all pages that might contain one are available on the online repository. We also have not found any copyright registrations for issues between 1978 and 1989. Therefore, any issues that were published before 1989 without copyright notices are now in the public domain in the United States.",
