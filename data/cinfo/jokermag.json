      "A note in the 1975 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The first issue renewal was recorded in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, and was filed in 1974.",
      "Issue numbering in this serial was inconsistent.  Volume 2 number 1, dated Summer 1946 and the earliest issue to be renewed, was followed by Volume 1 number 10, dated Winter 1946-47.  We do not know what issues, if any, were published between number 4 in 1943 and volume 2 number 1 in 1946, but the 'Cartoons - Comedy - Gags - Wit' subtitle used in both issues suggests some continuity between them."
