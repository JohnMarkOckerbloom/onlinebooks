   "additional-note": "The Denver Westerners appear to have issued their Brand Book under varying titles and frequencies, sometimes as a monthly magazine, and sometimes as an annual.  The earliest issue renewal we have found is for volume 1 of the annual, copyrighted in 1946, and renewed under Books in 1974. It is possible that annual renewals might also cover the same content in monthly issues that were published within 28 years of the renewal filing.",
