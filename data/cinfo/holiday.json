   "A 1974 renewal for 'Inside USA' by John Gunther mentions that portions were previously published in Holiday magazine, without giving dates.  Gunther does not have any articles credited to him in Holiday's tables of contents prior to the January 1947 issue.  (There is also another January 1947 piece by another author that is explicitly dated in its renewal record.)"
