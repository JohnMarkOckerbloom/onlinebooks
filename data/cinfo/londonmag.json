    "This is a British publication.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US.",
    "Due to some oddities in the CCE renewal record for 'Temple Tower', we are not sure whether the first installment copyrighted in 1929 would be in the January or the February 1929 issue.  We note that January 1929 issue here as the first one with an active copyright renewal to be on the safe side."
