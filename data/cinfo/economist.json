Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. However, a scan of the January 12, 1946 issue shows a US postal registration, which may imply simultaneous US publication (as copyright law considers it) for at least part of the 20th century.",
