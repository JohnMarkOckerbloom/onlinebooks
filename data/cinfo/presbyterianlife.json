      "A 1977 renewal for the 1950 book 'Early Christians of the 21st century' by Chad Walsh mentions that two chapters were previously published in 1949 issues of Presbyterian Life.  The renewal does not mention issue dates, but the earliest copyright-1949 issue of this magazine is volume 2, number 2, dated January 22, 1949 and copyrighted January 14, 1949.",
     "There was also a 1977 renewal for 'Letter from Mister Dee R. Laird to the Reverend John F. Phipps',  that ran in the April 16, 1949 issue.  If this appeared prior to the Walsh chapters, or the Walsh chapters are not covered by the renewal mentioned above, then this letter would be the earliest renewed contribution."
