   "A note in the 1976 July-December CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The first cataloged issue renewal, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the September 1948 issue (the first one published), and was filed in June 1976.",
   "Although the Grand Comics Database only records three issues under this title, the July-December 1977 CCE volume also records renewals by the same publishing company for six other issues under this title beginning in April 1949 (starting over with volume 1, number 1) and continuing into 1950. We are not sure about the nature of these issues, but some online searches suggest they may have been more traditionally formatted popular magazines, rather than comics."
