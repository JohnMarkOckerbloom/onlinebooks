      "Copyright was automatically renewed on any issue where copyright was claimed in a timely fashion.  The earliest issue we have found that had a copyright notice is the May 4, 1968 issue.  We have not examined all prior issues, however. Not all issues after May 4, 1968 have a copyright notice.  Issues we have been able to examine where we found a copyright notice are listed here, but there may be additional issues that remain under copyright. We have so far only evaluated a few issues from the 1970s for their copyright status.",
