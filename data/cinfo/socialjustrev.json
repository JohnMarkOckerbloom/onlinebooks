It is the first that we have found with a copyright notice on the issue, and the issue's 1966 copyright automatically renewed.  Most other issues did not include copyright notices.",
       "This magazine occasionally reprinted articles from elsewhere with notices for copyrights that might still be active. The earliest we have found with such a notice is a reprint of an article from the Liguorian Sunday Bulletin that appears in the December 1967 issue of this periodical with a 1967 copyright notice. It is possible there are earlier articles with active copyright notices that we have not found.",
    "We are not aware of any renewals filed that specifically mention the Social Justice Review."
