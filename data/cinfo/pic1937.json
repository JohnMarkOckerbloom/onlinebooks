The Summer 1949 issue (v. 21 no. 2) was 'Pic Quarterly Racing Pictorial'.  Fall 1949 (v. 21 no. 3) brought the Football Pictorial issue, and Winter 1949-1950 (v. 21 no. 4) was the Sports Review issue.  After Wagner took over the Pic title, Street and Smith continued to bring out sports issues under 'Street and Smith's All Star Sports' and various other titles for some years into the 1950s."],
