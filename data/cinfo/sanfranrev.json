      "Some book renewal records mention the San Francisco Review.  A 1990 renewal for Louis Simpson's 1962 book 'Riverside Drive' mentions that 'parts of two chapters appeared in San Francisco Review', and might cover parts, if any, that were published there in 1962.  A 1989 renewal for Zdena Berger's 1961 book 'Tell Me Another Morning' mentions that portions were published in the Autumn 1959 issue, but the renewal would appear to be too late to cover the 1959 San Francisco Review publications.",
      "The renewal record for R. G. Vliet's 'The Ants' says it ran in the San Francisco Review, but the date and the copyright registration ID indicate that it ran in the later San Francisco Review Annual."
