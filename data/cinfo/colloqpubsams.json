     "The first renewal for a volume in this monograph series was for volume 33, 'Differential Algebra', and was filed under Books, not Periodicals.  The CCE renewal record did not mention this series. Before concluding other volumes in the series are in the public domain, search for renewals for them under their distinctive title. We have not systematically checked volume titles for this serial past volume 33.",
     "An active copyright renewal was also filed for a revised edition of volume 31, 'Functional Analysis and Semi-Groups'.  The revised edition was published in 1957.  We did not find a copyright renewal for the original edition, published in 1948. We have not systematically checked renewals for other revised editions."
