   "additional-note": "The first renewal record shown here was in the Books renewals volume rather than in the Periodicals renewals volume. Titles of these volumes varies somewhat, and some are primarily monographs, which may be referred to by the monograph title.  We here record the earliest CCE renewals mentioning the specific series, but copyright researchers might also want to check renewals for monograph titles in volumes of interest to them.  (We have not systematically checked renewals under those titles.)",
