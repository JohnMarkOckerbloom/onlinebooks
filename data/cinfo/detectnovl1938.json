     "No contribution renewals specifically mention this magazine; however, it did sometimes reprint stories from other publications, which might have active copyrights due to renewal or GATT restoration.  The first likely candidate of this sort is 'The Third Degree' by British and Canadian author Maurice Dix, which first ran in a 1935 issue of the British magazine 'The Thriller', and was reprinted in the June 1938 issue of this magazine.",
     "This magazine published as Detective Novel Magazine from August 1944 onward."
