     "A note in the 1970 Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information for 'Kid Comics'.  The first cataloged issue renewal for Kid Komics, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the February 1943 issue, and was filed in May 1970. We know of no issues of any comic with a title spelled 'Kid Comics' published that year.",
     "Issues 1-10 are titled 'Kid Komics'.  The cover title of issue 11 is 'Kid Movie Komics', but its CCE renewal record gives the title as 'Kid Komics' like its predecessors."
