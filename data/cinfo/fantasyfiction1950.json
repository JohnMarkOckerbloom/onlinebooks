      "The only CCE renewal record that specifically mentions this magazine is a 1977 renewal for the story 'I'll Take Care of You' by Oliver LaFarge, which the record says was published in the May 1950 issue of Fantasy Fiction.  While I have not examined that issue myself, I do not find that story listed in the tables of contents databases linked in this record.  Those databases say that story was published in the June 1952 issue of Famous Fantastic Mysteries, however.",
      "There are no other issue or contribution renewals mentioned in CCE or the registered works database for either issue of this magazine (the first of which was titled 'Fantasy Fiction', the second and last of which was titled 'Fantasy Stories').",
      "Some of the stories in this magazine, however, were reprints, as noted in the tables of contents links.  We have not systematically checked to see if any of them have active renewed copyrights from their original publication."
