The first cataloged issue renewal, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the January-March 1946 issue, and was filed in 1973.",
     "A 1975 renewal for the 1947 book '450 Stories From Life', edited by Leonard Rush Jenkins, mentions that the stories in the book were previously published in The Secret Place, but the CCE entry does not give dates for those publications. The renewal could conceivably renew copyrights for articles in that magazine from 1947, but we have not verified whether it did."
