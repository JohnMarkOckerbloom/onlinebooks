Library coverage of this serial is spotty, but issue dates in the renewal records suggest that Vogue Patterns and Vogue Patterns Catalog[ue] are the same monthly publication, distinct from Vogue Mid-Month Collection, Vogue Patterns of the Month, and Children's Vogue Patterns. I am not sure if Vogue Pattern Book started out distinct from this publication or as a separate publication, but the first renewed issue of Vogue Pattern Book is after July 1927.",
