The fifth volume is the first for which we can find a renewal  we are sure is for a volume in this series.  There are other copyright renewals for works titled 'Medicinal Chemistry', including a renewal for volume 1 of 'Medicinal Chemistry' by Alfred Burger published in 1951.  We believe that is a different work from volume 1 of the ACS series, which was also published in 1951, but those wishing to use that volume should double-check.",
