   "Some images from the New York Evening Journal were renewed separately in the Artwork section, rather than in the Contributions to Periodicals section.  The first such image with an active copyright is by George Herriman, and is titled 'Us husbands. What do you mean, I never go out.'.  It ran in the January 16, 1926 issue, and was renewed in 1953.  The first contribution to be renewed in the Contributions to periodicals section of the CCE ran in the January 30, 1926 issue, and was also renewed in 1953.",
