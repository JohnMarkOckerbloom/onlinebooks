Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. However, there is a US place of publication, and some US correspondents, mentioned on journal volumes.  If issues were regularly published in or sent to the US close enough in time to the British publication, their original contents might be ineligible for GATT restoration.",
