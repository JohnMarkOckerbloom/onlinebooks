Some earlier indexes published under different titles (such as 'Cumulative Index to the National Geographic Magazine'), may still have actively renewed book copyrights.  We have not checked to see whether any of the 'Handy Key' indexes reuse copyrightable material from those earlier indexes. There are also some retrospective indexes published under the 'Handy Key...' title that were published after 1954, but that cover earlier issues.",
