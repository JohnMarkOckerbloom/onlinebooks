     "A note in the 1975 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The renewal for the first issue was recorded in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, and was filed in 1975.",
     "The July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume renewals section has an entry for 'True Crime Cases' that simply says 'See 10 True Crime Cases'.  There does also appear to have been another 1940s periodical titled 'True Crime Cases' that began before this one, however.  We did not find any renewals for it in either the CCE or the registered works database."
