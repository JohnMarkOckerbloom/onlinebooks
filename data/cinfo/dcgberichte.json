    "The renewals made in 1968 are for issues reported to be copyrighted under the German Proclamation of July 12, 1967. (No active renewals were reported in earlier years.) The earliest issue reported in the 1968 renewals is volume 55, number 1, copyright January 14, 1922; we assume that the renewal for all the 1922 and 1923 copyrights mentioned have expired by 2019.",
