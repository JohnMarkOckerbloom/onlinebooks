     "There was no strong title to this monograph series, which was published by the RAND Corporation.  Each monograph had an issue designation starting with 'R-' and followed by a number, e.g. 'R-105'. Some issue designations also had additional letters and numbers after the first number, e.g. 'R-4244/6-HA'. 'R' or 'RAND Reports' did not appear as titles on the reports we have checked.  Because of the ubiquity of 'R' in titles, we have only checked for renewals specifically mentioning RAND Reports, Project RAND, or the RAND Corporation. Copyright checks for specific reports should also search for renewals of the individual report titles.",
     "Copyright notices do not appear in many of the reports we have spot-checked, but they do appear in some of them."
