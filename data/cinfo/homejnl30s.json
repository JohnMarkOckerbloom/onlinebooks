     "This is (most likely) a British publication.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US.",
     "The first contribution renewal shown here is for Georgette Heyer's 'Danger in the Dark', listed as published in the Home Journal from March 20 through May 1, 1937.  The copyright registrations indicate a non-US publication.  This is most likely the London-based Home Journal that appears to have run from 1934 to 1939, but we have not eliminated the possibility that it could be some other publication."
