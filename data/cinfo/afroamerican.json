   "additional-note": "The Afro-American (now also known as 'Afro') had variously titled editions around the country; the 1923-1964 editions I can find in Worldcat all appear to have 'Afro-American' in the title.  The main edition was the Baltimore Afro-American. Keyword searches for 'Afro-American' in CCE and the registered works database turn up no active issue renewals. The first recorded contribution renewal was for Langston Hughes' 'Big Sea', whose renewal record says it was serialized in 'Afro-American newspapers' beginning in March 1940.",
