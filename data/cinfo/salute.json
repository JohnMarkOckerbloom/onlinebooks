      "There appear to have been multiple magazines titled 'Salute' published in the 1940s and 1950s.  Documentation for these magazines is difficult to find, so here we report on all relevant magazines published under that title.",
      "Comedy Publications published an issue numbered volume 1, number 1 in April 1943.  I know of no further issues from this publisher.  In 1945, Weintraub Brothers began to register issues of 'Salute', starting with volume 1, number 2.  In 1946, Vet Publishers registered a magazine titled 'Salute' starting with volume 1, number 1.  Worldcat reports that their publication was 'produced by former editors and writers of Yank and Stars and Stripes'.  Meanwhile, Weintraub Brothers continued to publish issues under their own numbering into the 1950s.",
      "A note in the 1970 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information for Salute.  The first cataloged active issue renewal for any magazine with this title is for the April 1943 issue of Salute published by Comedy Publications.  It was filed in 1970, with the claimant Magazine Management Company, doing business as Marvel Comics Group, though it does not appear in the Catalog of Copyright Entries until the July-December 1977 Periodicals volume.",
      "The first contribution renewal for a magazine titled Salute is for a piece in the May 1946 Salute published by Vet Publishers."
