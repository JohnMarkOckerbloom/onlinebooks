      "Multiple parts of the annual Moody's Manual of Investments were renewed starting with 1952 editions, including 'Banks, Insurance, Real Estate, Investment Trust', 'Government Securities', 'Industrial Securities', 'Public Utilities Securities', and 'Transportation, Railroads, Airlines, Shipping, Traction, Bus and Truck Lines' These appear to have evolved into serials of their own in 1954 and 1955, as noted in the 'succeeded by' links in this record.",
      "Annual editions may include revised material from prior editions."
