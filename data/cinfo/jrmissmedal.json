     "A note in the 1975 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The renewal for the first issue of this series was recorded in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, and was filed in 1975.",
     "Prior to this series, both Bilbara and Cornell publishing companies published a single issue of 'Junior Miss' in late 1944. The series described here, which begins with number 24 in 1947, may be a successor to one of those, but we are not certain of which one if so. We base the extent of this series on the Grand Comics Database listings."
