The other is a 1987 renewal for the 1959 book 'Counseling and Psychotherapy: Theory and Practice' by Cecil Helden Patterson.  That renewal mentions that part of the book was previously published in the American Journal of Psychotherapy.  We do not know the date of that prior publication, or it it would be covered by the book's renewal. (A pre-1959 publication presumably would not be.)",
