The first cataloged issue renewal, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the December 1939 issue. The November 1939 issue is apparently a reprint of 'Marvel Comics #1', cover-dated October 1939, so the contribution renewals for the November issue may also apply to the October issue.",
