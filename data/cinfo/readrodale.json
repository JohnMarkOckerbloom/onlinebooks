     "Notes in CCE Periodicals volumes from 1970 onward say to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information for 'Read'.  The first issue renewal of the 'Read' magazine published by Rodale Press, and later by 'Read Magazine, Inc.', is recorded in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, and was filed in 1973. We have not found evidence that this particular magazine was published after the 1940s, though other magazines also named 'Read' were.",
     "This appears to be distinct from a different magazine called 'Read!' that began in 1943 and may have ended that year as well.  It also is distinct from the school magazine 'Read' published by Wesleyan University and others starting in the 1950s."
