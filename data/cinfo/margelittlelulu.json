      "The Little Lulu character first appeared in the February 23, 1935 issue of the Saturday Evening Post, and in many Post issues thereafter. The February 23, 1935 Saturday Evening Post, like most other issues of the Post from then on, has an active copyright renewal.",
      "The word 'Marge's' appeared in smaller lettering than 'Little Lulu' on most of the covers of this series. It was dropped from the title in the 1970s.",
      "Prior to this series, several 'Marge's Little Lulu' comics were published in Dell's 'Four Color Comic' series, and were renewed as books. Some other 'Little Lulu'-related titles have also been published and renewed as books, as greeting cards, and in other categories as well."
