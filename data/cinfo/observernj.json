Its original registration, and one for another renewed 1949 contribution by Jordan, place the publication in Metedeconk and Breton Woods, New Jersey, which are two neighborhoods in Brick Township, Ocean County.  While it is not entirely clear which 'Observer' published these contributions, newspapers with 'Observer' in the title have been published in Ocean County for a long time.",
