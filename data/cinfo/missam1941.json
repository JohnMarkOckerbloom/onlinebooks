     "A note in the 1969 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The first cataloged issue renewal, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the August 1941 issue, and was filed in 1969.",
     "The 'Miss America' title was also used for later magazines and comics in the 1940s and 1950s.  We are not aware of issues of this early series past 1942, but issues and information on this series are now hard to find. Issue 2 was registered by H-K Publications, issue 3 by Hockley Publications; both were renewed by Magazine Management Company, doing business as Marvel Comics Group."
