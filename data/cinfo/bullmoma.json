   "comment": "Issue renewals were not found in Periodicals section of CCE. For book renewals, we've checked 1960-1961 to ensure no mentions missing; might need to search 'modern' for years after that to find all possible renewals, but the first renewal headed by 'Museum of Modern Art' is from 1968.",
   "additional-notes": [
      "The first renewal of this periodical is recorded in the Books section of the CCE rather than the Periodicals section.  Some other renewals are so recorded as well.",
      "Some issues of this serial have distinctive titles. Before concluding such issues are in the public domain, search for renewals for books under those titles.  We have not systematically done such searches for this serial. If an issue of interest is in one of the subseries of the Bulletin, such as 'Painting and Sculpture Acquisitions', also search for renewals under the subseries title."
