   "additional-note": "We have checked the distinctive titles of the volumes in this series that were first published between 1929 and 1964, as well as the overall series title.   The volume on Ezekiel, first published in 1936, may have come out first in Britain, and may therefore still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if it meets GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. The volume on Kings, first published in 1951, is credited to two American authors, however, so would appear not to be subject to GATT restoration.",
