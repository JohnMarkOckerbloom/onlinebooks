Kennedy mentions that a portion of the book was previously published in volume 4, number 1, part 2 of Coordinator's Cyclopedic Federal Tax Service.  We do not know the date of that publication, but this renewal could conceivably renew the copyright of that portion if it was published in 1947 or 1948.",
