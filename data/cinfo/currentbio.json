      "This was published both as an annual (known by the mid-1950s as 'Current Biography Yearbook') and as a monthly publication.  The renewals we have found are for the annual, and were filed under Books.  They may also cover material published the same year in the monthly issues, which were apparently reprinted (sometimes in updated form) in the annuals.",
      "It is also possible that biographical material about a particular person in a renewed publication might be reprinted in an updated article about that person in a later publication."
