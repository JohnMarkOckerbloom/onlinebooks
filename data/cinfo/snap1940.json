      "A note in the 1969 CCE Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information.  The first cataloged issue renewal, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the April 1941 issue, and was filed in December 1968.",
      "The Snap that began in 1940 was a pinup photography magazine published by the 'Snap Pub. Co.'.  A differently numbered series of 'Snap', a humor comic that also featured scantily clad women, began in 1943, and was also initially registered by the 'Snap Pub. Co'. We are not sure if these should be considered the same magazine, but renewals for both series were filed by Magazine Management Company, doing business as Marvel Comics Group."
