This is an inventory of periodicals and their first copyright renewals
(if any).
Most periodicals published in the US prior to 1964 had to renew their
issue copyrights after 28 years in order to retain copyright on the issue.
(Contributions included within the issue could also have their own copyrights,
which can be independent of their issue's copyright.)
For more information on copyright renewal requirements,
see <a href="../renewals.html">this page</a>.
<p>
The list below should include all of the more than 1000
periodicals with renewed issue or contribution copyrights
(for 1923-1950 issues) between
1950 and 1977, as well as selected periodicals
with renewals filed between 1978 and 1992,
or that do not have copyright renewals.
(After 1992, copyright renewal was automatic or no longer required.)
This may be useful as a guide to people who are interested
in digitizing certain
periodicals, to point out serials for which further copyright research
may be fruitful.

Some caveats to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li> Many periodicals first published abroad, as well as those published after 1963, are exempt from renewal requirements, so can still be copyrighted despite the lack of a renewal.
<li> Contributions to periodicals could be registered separately.  So even though a particular magazine issue was not renewed, a contribution appearing in it might have been, and would therefore still be under copyright.  (This is particularly common for literary contributions.)  If you see a periodical listed with an issue renewal but with no mention of contribution renewals, there were no contribution renewals filed for it for material published before 1950, but there might be contribution renewals for material published in 1950 or later.
<li> Artwork, photographs, dramas, music, and other types of works appearing in periodicals may also have been registered separately, and are not represented here.  Check these categories where appropriate.
<li> Periodicals, particularly newspapers, may include material that originated  elsewhere (such as wire service stories, syndicated comics and columns, and reprints).  Those may be still copyrighted even if the material original to the periodical is not.  You may need to check the copyright for such externally produced materials separately.  (Note that we only track original contributions here, not reprinted or syndicated contributions, but sometimes the 'more information' page linked to a serial listed here might mention or link to information on reprints.)
<li> Some serials (in particular, some law reports and annuals, and irregular or undated serials) were not renewed in the periodicals section, but in the books section.   A few early serials of this type are included here; others might not be.
<li> We may have made mistakes or omissions in our summaries.  You should
double-check any registrations for periodicals you think might be in the
public domain, and should not rely on this page as the last word on
renewal data, or for legal advice.
<li> Not all periodicals kept renewing issues once they started.  Some
of the periodicals here may have only renewed certain issues, or stopped
after a certain point.  Don't assume that all issues after the first 
renewal shown here are necessary under copyright as well.
<li> This listing is not complete for periodicals whose first renewed issue or contribution was 1950 or later.  You'll need to check the <a href="http://cocatalog.loc.gov/">registered works database</a> for those.
</ul>
