While there are no active contribution renewal records specifically mentioning this magazine, we have not systematically checked the copyrights of stories that first appeared in other publications. The FictionMags contents listings may give more information about where they first appeared, and those publications can then be checked to see if an active copyright exists on the first publication.."
