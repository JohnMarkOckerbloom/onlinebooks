The copyright claimant on the first contribution renewal is King Features Syndicate. Issue renewals of the Journal-American, and renewals of included comics that also appeared in King Features' weeklies or other publications, may also apply to this serial's content. We have not systematically surveyed those renewals here.",
   "We are not certain about this serial's relationship with Saturday Home magazine, which was also a newspaper supplement that had King Features as a copyright claimant."
