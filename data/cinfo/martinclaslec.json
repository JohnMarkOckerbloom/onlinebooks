     "Issue renewals for this serial are recorded beginning in the 1961 January-June Books issue of the CCE, but the renewal for the lowest-numbered issue is recorded in the 1961 July-December Books issue.",
     "Issue renewals for this serial are generally filed under Books (rather than under Periodicals), under the issue's distinctive title. Before concluding issues are in the public domain, search for renewals for books under those distinctive titles.  You might also need to search under Drama, which sometimes includes works prepared for oral delivery such as lectures.  We have not systematically done Books or Drama searches for this serial."
