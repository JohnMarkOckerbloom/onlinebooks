      "Spot-checks of issues up to 1989, which were all typescript newsletters, did not turn up copyright notices. Our determination of the first automatically 'renewed' issue is based on the apparent lack of notices, and a presumption that the Spring 1989 issue was published after notices became optional in March 1989.",
