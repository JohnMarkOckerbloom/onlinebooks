   "additional-note": "A 1973 renewal for 'A Date With Diane' by Elizabeth Headley mentions that stories from the book were previously published in Gateway, among other places, but the CCE entry does not give dates for those publications.  The renewal could conceivably renew copyrights for her stories in that magazine as early as 1945, but we have not verified whether it did.  The author also published under the names Betty Cavanna and Betsy Allen.",
