      "The first renewal record noted here is filed under the title of the volume, 'The Tlingit Indians', and not under the serial name.  This is a monographic series.  Before concluding a volume is in the public domain, search for renewals for a volume under its distinctive title. Most volumes after volume 26 also have active copyright renewals, but we have not systematically checked volume titles for this serial past volume 33.",
