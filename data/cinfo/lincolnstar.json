   "additional-note": "Some copyright renewals for the Superman comic strip cite the Sunday Journal and Star, a Sunday newspaper published by the Lincoln Star in collaboration with the Lincoln Journal.  The earliest renewal mentioned citing that newspaper is for a strip published January 5, 1958. There are earlier renewals for Superman citing other papers, and it is quite possible that earlier Superman strips, or other copyright-renewed syndicated comics, were also published in the Lincoln Star.",
