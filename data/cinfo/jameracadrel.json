     "Copyright is presumed here based on automatic renewal of issue copyrights, but issues before 1989 may still be in the public domain if there is no copyright notice in them (and no registration was made in time, for years when that can remedy lack of notice).  We have not found such notices in early issues, but we might not have access to all pages. Registrations are recorded in the Copyright Office database at least as early as the December 1977 issue, and earlier registrations may be recorded in CCE.",
