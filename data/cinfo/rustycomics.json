     "A note in the 1975 Periodicals volume says to 'consult copyright office' for full issue renewal information for 'Rustic Comics'. There is a similar note for 'Rusty Comics' in the 1976 January-June Periodicals volume. The first cataloged issue renewal for Rusty Comics, mentioned in the July-December 1977 CCE Periodicals volume, is for the June 1947 issue, and was filed in 1975. We know of no issues of any comic with the title 'Rustic Comics' published in 1947.",
     "Issue 21 says 'Rusty and Her Family' on the cover, but the indicia title, and the title under which its renewal record is filed in the CCE, remains 'Rusty Comics'."
