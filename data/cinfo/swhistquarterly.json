Goetzmann mentions that parts of the book appeared in altered form in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly.  The only article we know that Goetzmann published in that magazine up to 1959 was 'The United States-Mexican Boundary Survey, 1848-1853', which ran in the October 1958 issue, too early to be covered by a 1987 renewal.",
