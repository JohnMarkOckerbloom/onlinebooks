      "The renewal record for the first renewed story in this periodical (Ray Bradbury's 'The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl', aka 'Touch and Go'), says it was published in the Spring 1949 issue, but FictionMags says it was published in the Winter 1948 issue.  We have not examined the issues ourselves to determine which issue it appeared in, but note the earlier issue in this record to be on the safe side.",
      "This periodical included reprints and abridgements of previously published books.  Those books may have their own copyrights that also apply to the versions published in this magazine, and we have not systematically checked their renewal status."],
