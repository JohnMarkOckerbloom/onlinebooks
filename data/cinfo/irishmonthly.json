   "additional-note" : "This is an Irish publication.  Its contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US. However, note that an American publisher is also listed on issue covers by 1922, and some later issues also note second-class registration with the US Postal Service.  Content published in the US close enough in time to publication in Ireland might be ineligible for GATT restoration.",
