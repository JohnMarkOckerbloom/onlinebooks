     "Some issues are titled Children's Vogue Patterns Catalogue.  Library coverage of this serial is spotty, but issue dates in the renewal records suggest that Children's Vogue Patterns and Children's Vogue Patterns Catalogue are the same seasonal publication, distinct from Vogue Patterns. Renewals are typically filed under Books, rather than under Periodicals.",
     "We currently know of no active renewals for serials by these titles.  There are some active renewals for Vogue pattern books for children's and young people's clothing (e.g. from the 1950s), but they have other titles."
