Library coverage of this serial is spotty, but issue dates in the renewal records suggest that Children's Vogue Patterns and Children's Vogue Patterns Catalogue are the same seasonal publication, distinct from Vogue Patterns. Renewals are typically filed under Books, rather than under Periodicals.",
