      "We did not find any renewal records specifically mentioning The Equinox, but we did find one for 'Liber Aleph. Vol. 111: The Book of Wisdom and Folly', which was published as Volume 3 number 6 of The Equinox.  Some other issues also have distinctive titles, and determinations of their copyright status should include searching for renewals under those titles. We have not systematically done such searches.",
     "Some issues were originally published in Great Britain. Their contents may still be copyrighted even without renewals or copyright notices, if they meet GATT copyright restoration requirements for works first published outside the US."
