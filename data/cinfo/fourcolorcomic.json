      "This was a series of standalone comics published with distinct titles. Each had an issue number, and 'Four Color Comic' appeared as a secondary title (or not at all) on most copies.  Records for issue renewals were often filed under their individual titles, usually as books (though 'Hubert at Camp Moonbeam', number 251, had a renewal filed in the January-June 1977 Periodicals volume of the CCE).  Individual issue renewals might or might not mention Four Color Comic or the issue number. The first issue to be renewed, number 5, was titled 'Raggedy Ann and Andy'.",
      "Some titles published in this series went on to have series of their own.  Our 'See Also' links here go to ones we know about."
