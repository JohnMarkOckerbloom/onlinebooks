   "overview": "Framed as a letter to the author's teenage son, Ta-Nehisi Coates's book makes a pessimistic evaluation of American race relations, warning his son that 'racist violence... has been woven into American culture'. Part memoir, part historical argument, Coates's book drew praise from authors like Toni Morrison, won the National Book Award for nonfiction, and was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction.",

       "description": "A Chapin High School teacher was told by school officials to {ln:https://www.postandcourier.com/columbia/halted-lesson-using-book-on-racism-draws-censorship-claims-from-sc-educators-group/article_adffcc98-15dd-11ee-bac1-171ee392f932.html|stop a lesson in her AP Language and Composition class centered on this book}. Some parents and students had complained about the lesson, which they said made them feel 'uncomfortable' and 'ashamed to be Caucasian'.  School officials expressed concern 'about the lesson possibly violating a state budget provision banning the use of state money for teaching certain ideas about race and gender.' The South Carolina Education Association and National Education Association replied with a letter supporting the teacher as using the book to 'help teach students how to write and engage with argumentative essays, including how to grapple with a text and argument with which they might disagree.'"
