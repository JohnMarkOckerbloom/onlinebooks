       "description": "The Associated Press reported in March 1996 that Merrimack, NH schools had pulled this play from the curriculum after the school board passed a 'prohibition of alternative lifestyle instruction' act. Readers from Merrimack informed me in 1999 that school board members who had passed the act had been voted out, after the uproar resulting from the act's passage, and that the play is now used again in Merrimack classrooms. The Library at Occidental College has {ln:http://sites.oxy.edu/special-collections/bannedbooks/bannedbooksweek.htm|an online exhibit} on the censorship of Shakespeare through history."
