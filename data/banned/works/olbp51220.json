       "description": "New Utah laws making it easier for book challenges to remove books from school libraries were quickly used to challenge religious primary texts.  {ln:https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2024/03/13/parents-challenged-book-mormon/|The Salt Lake Tribune reports} that a challenge that led {wk:olbp51209|the Bible} to be removed from some school library shelves was quickly quashed after public outrage.  But a similar challenge to the Qur'an left that book in limbo for eight months. The incident highlights the potential for books representing minority viewpoints becoming more vulnerable than widely revered books to banning under 'neutral' but overbearing censorship regimes. (Utah's new laws also come up in our profile of {wk:Q2032398|Oryx and Crake}.)"
