   "overview": "Thomas Paine became famous for supporting the cause of the American Revolution in works like Common Sense.  Hoping that revolution would be followed by a 'revolution in the system of religion', he wrote this argument for deism and rationalism, and against Biblical religion and atheism, while living in revolutionary France.  His writings got him into trouble in France, where he narrowly escaped execution, and this work in particular made him scorned in America, where he died in 1809.  It remains in print today, and is still referred to by other critics of religion.",

       "description": "Thomas Williams was found guilty of blasphemy for publishing this book, and sentenced to a year of hard labor and a fine of one thousand pounds.  Despite this harsh sentence, at least two other publishers persisted in publishing the book in the early 1800s, and were sentenced to comparable or worse punishments by British courts.  Defending himself in an 1819 trial, Richard Carlile read the entire book to the jury, which made its contents part of the public court record.  Over 10,000 copies of the court record were sold, and John Stuart Mill reported the book was widely read in the years that followed.",
