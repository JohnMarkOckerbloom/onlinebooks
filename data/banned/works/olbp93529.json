       "description": "As this book was deliberately printed in defiance of the Licensing Order, it was effectively automatically banned legally from the time of publication. (Other rules that require permission from external authorities before a publisher can print a book, a librarian or bookseller can stock it, or a teacher can teach from it, can effectively work as bans in much the same way.)   <cite>Areopagita</cite> was also explicitly condemned by Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell in 1658.  England's licensing regime continued until 1694, 20 years after Milton's death.  After 1644, this book was not republished until 1738."
