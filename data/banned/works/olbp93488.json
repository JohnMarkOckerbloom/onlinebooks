Originally published in 1914, it was reissued in several editions thereafter (though all are now thoroughly out of date from the standpoint of medical knowledge).  Distribution was initially difficult due to the {ln:http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=017/llsl017.db&recNum=0639|Comstock Law of 1873}, which prohibited 'any article whatever for the prevention of conception... or... notice of any kind stating when, where, how, or of whom, or by what means [such an article] can be purchased or obtained.'",

       "description": "William Sanger, the author's husband, was jailed for violating the Comstock Law by distributing this pamphlet. Margaret Sanger herself had fled the country to avoid prosecution, but would return in 1916 to start the American Birth Control League, which eventually merged with other groups to form Planned Parenthood."
