   "overview": "In this first novel by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison, an 11-year old Black girl prays for her eyes to turn blue, so she can be as happy and accepted as the blue-eyed white children she sees seem to be.  Her own life has been much more traumatic, with incidents of racism, violence, and rape, with some of the worst trauma inflicted by her own family. The book is narrated in a complex, experimental style.",
