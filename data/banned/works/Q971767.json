   "overview": "This novel by Nobel laureate Toni Morison was inspired by an 1856 incident of a cornered refugee killing her young child rather than have her be re-enslaved. The novel does not soften the horrors inflicted by slavery, or by its survivors, and includes disturbing descriptions of violence, including sexual violence. The novel was a finalist for the 1987 National Book Award, and won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1988.",
