       "description": "After a parent blamed this book, and a teacher who had it in her classroom library, for one of her children coming out as transgender and attempting to run away from her home, the Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District board of trustees voted to adopt a policy that {ln:https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/transgender-student-texas-grapevine-podcast-rcna118116|'prohibited reading materials or classroom discussions mentioning the possibility that someoneâ€™s gender could be different from their biological sex'}.  Faced with the new policy, and harassed by her community, the teacher brought her books home, and eventually left the district. After petitioning a court for change of custody, the parent's daughter also left Texas to live with her father, citing new state policies restricting transgender care, and not the book, as a key reason for leaving."
