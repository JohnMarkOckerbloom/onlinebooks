   "overview": "Voltaire's biting satire of optimism skewered religion, philosophy, governments, and civil, military, and religious leaders.  When first published in French in 1759, it drew condemnation from both church and state, but it also gained admiration by scholars, and is frequently taught in university classes today.  More recent censorship of the book has tended to cite the sexual aspects of some of the many examples of misconduct and atrocities depicted in the book.",
