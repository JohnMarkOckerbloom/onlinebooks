       "description": "Prior to the Civil War, many southern states outlawed the possesssion of abolitionist literature, particularly by African Americans. In 1857, {ln:https://harriettubmanbyway.org/rev-sam-greens-descendant-speak-oct-6/|Samuel Green}, a lay minister who had been freed from slavery in 1837, was arrested and charged with 'knowingly having in his possession a certain abolition pamphlet called Uncle Tomâ€™s Cabin, of an inflammatory character and calculated to create discontent amongst the colored population of this State.'  The Maryland law he was charged with violating carried a minimum jail sentence of 10 years, but Green was eventually freed in 1862 on the condition that he leave the state."
