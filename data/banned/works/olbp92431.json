       "description": "At the urging of John Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppresssion of Vice, the US Postal Service seized copies of 'The Little Review', a magazine that was printing installments of <cite>Ulysses</cite>.  A court ruled that the novel was obscene the following year, effectively banning its publication in the US. After years of intense advocacy for the book, the federal court for the Southern District of the New York lifted the ban in 1933, and an appeals court upheld that decision in 1934."
