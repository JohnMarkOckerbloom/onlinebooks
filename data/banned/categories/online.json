   "title": "Books freely readable online",
   "introduction": "Here you can find books you can read for free on your computer, without having to go to a library or bookstore, and without anyone stopping you (unless your computer or network blocks the Internet site).  These books are either online with the permission of the copyright holder, or they're in the public domain.  Censorship attempts for some of these books were made long ago, but some have been subject to more recent censorship attempts."
