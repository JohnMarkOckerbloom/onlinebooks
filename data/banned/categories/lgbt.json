   "introduction": "Here are books that some people have banned, or attempted to ban, for their discussion or depiction of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or other people whose sexuality or gender is outside norms that they're comfortable with. While objections to these books are sometimes framed in terms of {cat:sex|sex}, this listing includes books where objection has been made to the type of people depicted, and not just their behavior.  In some cases the objection has simply been to depicting LGBT+ people happily and openly living in society."
