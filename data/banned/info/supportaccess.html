{pt:Support access to books}
<p>
This page includes links to resources on supporting institutions
that make books available to people, and that fight efforts to deny
access to them.
<h2>Supporting libraries</h2>
<ul> 
<li> Find out if your local libraries carry books in this exhibit that you value. (You can check library holdings for each book in this exhibit by following the "Borrow it from" links on the book information pages.) If your library has the books, consider thanking them.  (Librarians like to hear from people that appreciate what they're doing, and not just from people complaining about them.)  If they don't have the books, let them know you support adding them to their collection.

<li> Many libraries have Friends groups that support their activities and
help ensure the libraries are well-funded.  The American Library Association
(ALA)
has a useful information page on
<a href="https://ilovelibraries.org/get-involved/become-a-library-friend/">become a Library Friend</a>.
<li> Many libraries are governed by boards that are publicly elected,
have public meetings, or solicit comments from the public.  Whether or
not a library bans books, or resists attempts to ban them, can depend on
the membership of the board, and on what they hear from the public.
Ask your local librarian how its board of trustees or other overseers
are chosen, when they have public meetings, and 
where you can find out about board members and candidates.
If you're interested in joining a board yourself, you may be interested in
<a href="https://ilovelibraries.org/get-involved/become-a-library-trustee/">this ALA guide</a>.
<li> Local elections for library board members or funding initiatives often
have low turnouts.  If you know when the next election is, and who or what
is on the ballot, your participation and advocacy can make a big difference.
American can make sure they're registered to vote by going to 
<a href="https://vote.gov/">vote.gov</a> to find out how to register, check that their registration is up to date, and update their registration.
</ul> 
<h2>Fighting censorship</h2>
<ul>
<li> The American Library Association's <a href="https://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/oif">Office for Intellectual Freedom</a> tracks book challenges and threats to freedom to read in libraries across America.
<li> <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a> is a long-standing group of writers that advocate for freedom of expression.
<li> <a href="https://ncac.org/">The National Coalition Against Censorship</a> publicizes censorship incidents and advocates for freedom of expression.
<li> Amnesty International tracks issues related to <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/topic/censorship-and-freedom-of-expression/">censorship and freedom of expression</a> around the globe.
</ul>
