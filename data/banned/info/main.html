<p>This site features selected books that have been the objects of censorship
or censorship attempts.  Here you can read about these books, and about
attempts to ban them.  You can follow links to sites that discuss these books,
to the catalogs of libraries that may lend them to you, and to booksellers that
may sell you copies.  You can also read some of these books online for 
free via
<a href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/">The Online Books Page</a>.
<p>This site, now in public preview, will continue to grow through {ln:https://bannedbooksweek.org/|Banned Books Week 2023}
and beyond, and will eventually replace our older
<a href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html">Banned Books Online</a> exhibit after it is further developed and populated.
Comments and suggestions are welcome.
